    text: "Patrick and his awesome crew came out and expanded our back patio, laid decking, and covered it with a beautiful roof. They were super fast and responsive. It came out better than we could have imagined. This was the second project Patrick and did for us - the first was enclosing an open, unused loft space into a bedroom. We're already planning our next project and are grateful to have a reliable contractor who gets the job done right, on time, and at a competitive rate.",

He is instrumental in making my business run smooth and I consider him my right hand man. We are starting a million dollar project in VA Highlands Jan 2, 2020 and it's already on cruise control because of Patrick. On top of that, my clients instantly felt like he was the guy and emphasized that I was expected to use him on the project!!",

    text: "I have worked with Patrick and his crew for over 3 years and he is always my first choice for referring contract work of all kinds - big jobs to small. Patrick and Total Construction can handle the very basics from landscaping and pressure washing to detailed tiling, structural work and total renovation projects. There is no one that I'd rather to refer to my clients. Patrick is always professional, reliable and competitively priced and does the work he says he will do. Its rare to find a contractor of this caliber!",

    text: "I recently hired Total Construction and remodeling to finish a project of building a mother in law suite above my separate 2 car garage. I initially hired another local construction company which I regret to this day. After Patrick and his crew came in and fixed all the issues that I knew were done totally wrong by the other group. Then he actually had much better ideas on how to get the most out of my space for my investment. I was so happy with his craftsmanship, attention to detail, knowledge and overall genuine care for the project. Total Construction and remodeling does not want to just finish the project at hand they want to earn you as a customer for life like they have with me and my family.",

They have done several renovations for my family and business over the past three and a half years including additions, full gut jobs, decks, patios and more. I, literally, always make sure I have a project for them to do because I enjoy them and their work so much! Total Construction delivers quality results, timely work, and reasonable pricing. Total Construction has proven expertise and talented construction crews. This company provides excellent service and results.",

He and his crew have completed numerous projects in our home (covered deck, flagstone patio, outdoor grill/kitchen buildout, outdoor drain system, and some drywall work) and all the jobs exceeded expectations. I could not be happier with Patrick's professionalism and quality of work and gave recommended his services to numerous neighbors, who all turned out to be happy customers. Thanks Patrick!",

The most recent visit was during covid and they maintained social distance while using appropriate mouth and nose coverings. I have two projects this summer at my home that I will more than likely entrust them with. Highly recommended!",

    text: "We've had the pleasure of working with Patrick and his crew at Total Construction for several years now, and I can't recommend them enough. From start to finish, Patrick's attention to detail, communication, and expertise have consistently exceeded our expectations. Over the years, they've helped us with multiple projects, including a beautiful outdoor deck and a full-house painting job. Each time, Patrick took the time to understand our vision and needs, guiding us through every step of the process—from initial ideas to final touches. What I appreciate most is the seamless collaboration. Patrick and his team always ensure that we are informed, comfortable, and satisfied, while maintaining an exceptional standard of work. The outdoor deck they built is a standout feature of our home, beautifully designed and expertly constructed. It's become our go-to space for outdoor entertaining, and every time we have guests over, they're blown away by how great it looks. The painting work on the house was flawless, with crisp lines and vibrant, even coverage. The crew took extra care to protect our furniture and flooring. Patrick is truly a professional who takes pride in his craft, and it shows in every project. His team is punctual, hardworking, and always respectful of our space. What I admire most is their commitment to getting the job done right. If you're looking for quality work and a contractor you can trust, Total Construction is the way to go. We will definitely continue to hire them for any future projects. Thank you, Patrick, for consistently delivering outstanding results!",
